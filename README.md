# performance-analysis-of-different-edge-detection-techniques

Part a:
Apply Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian of Gaussian, and Canny edge detector on lena image.
Quantitively analyze the performance (using RMSE metric) of above-mentioned algorithms at five different variance levels (var=0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1) of Gaussian noise (added to the image manually). Square root of following relation can be used to compute RMSE.

Part b:
Analyze the performance of Canny Edge detector (in terms of detected edges) with varying threshold value.
